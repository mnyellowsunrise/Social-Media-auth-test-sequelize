Was trying to make a social media application and create a user auth + posts + comments system using sequelize, but couldn't get it working. Will likely switch to primsa for my next attempt. Also didn't use environment variables or bother hiding token password
because this is just a proof of concept I am hosting locally. Saving the files here to maybe edit them some other time.
